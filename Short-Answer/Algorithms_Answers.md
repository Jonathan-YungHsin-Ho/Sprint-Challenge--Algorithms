#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

The runtime complexity of this block of code would be `O(n^3)`, where n is the input size. This is because the `while` loop is running on the order on `n^3` times. While the code in the loop is increasing on the order of `n^2`, the higher polynomial order of `n^3` will dominate the `n^2` for large inputs.

b)

c)
